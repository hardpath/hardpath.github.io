## About
---

After almost 20 years working with Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT), my recent work has been centred on:

- Operational Technology: advanced control systems design and SCADA development for Marine and Nuclear applications.

- ICS Cybersecurity: 

- PLC Programming Training: provide training using simulated industrial environments and real or simulated PLCs.

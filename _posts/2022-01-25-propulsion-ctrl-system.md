  [Marine] Propulsion Control System for a DP Vessel
---

In a partnership with Siemens, the control systems of the two propulsion drives
of a Dynamic Positioning vessel were retrofitted.

The project aimed to maintain the existing functionality but increase the
availability of such a critical system whilst improving the diagnostics
capability.

The legacy Rockwell code was reviewed, and an in-depth Failure Mode Analysis
was performed to assess the optimal technical solution.

Two independent systems, one for each drive, were deployed. In addition, a
PROFINET interface between the PLC and the 2 MW Variable Frequency Drivers
(VFD) significantly reduced the number of hardwired connections.

On the Engine Control Room, graphical consoles were installed, which provides
information related to the start/stop sequence (current state and detailed
information about the transition conditions). Moreover, comprehensive
diagnostic information from the VFDs and instrumentation is now available to
the crew.

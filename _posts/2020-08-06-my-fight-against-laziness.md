The fight against laziness used to be the only fight I had on a daily basis.

I must confess that I spent hours on YouTube looking at motivational videos or speeches from someone who achieve something spectacular. However, for too much time, motivation was something that I pursued but led me to a dead end.

More severe than the time spent on YouTube was the time I spent in my life working on something that I didn't want and, even worst, not chasing what I kept dreaming. I'm not talking about one year or two spent. I'm talking about ten times that!

Some say that a big decision comes out of inspiration or desperation. In my case, desperation took precedence, and something changed. One day I moved to a different place, different culture, and I found myself only surrounded by thoughts.

## More Than Motivation

Maybe the emptiness of my days was the opportunity needed to find what I didn't found on YouTube. It was an opportunity to learn about meditation and mindfulness. It was an opportunity to learn about me.

Meditation and my focus on being mindful were very uncomfortable at the beginning. The struggle to keep this as a daily routine was almost embarrassing. But one day, that effort was starting to paying off.

I learned about myself. I put aside those thoughts that kept in the past and were hiding my vision to the future. I started looking beyond me. During this journey, I found something special. I found **purpose**.

## Driven by *Rage*

Having a clear purpose is driving me to be better every day. I want to be stronger, faster and smarter than yesterday. I spend my days striving for high performance and be the best I can be.

The purpose was the seed for this rage I have inside. This rage that drives me to get up at five every morning and work more than 70 hours a week. This rage that helps me to overcome all the *bs* *we all face daily. This rage that makes things happen and gets the job done.

I have no illusions, though. Having a purpose is not a pill that we take, and everything will conspire with us to take us there. During this journey, I found more obstacles than before. When my mind is not begging for me to quit, someone else is taking care of that.

However, having a purpose reminds me of why I gave the first step. The purpose keeps my rage alive. The purpose is the weapon I use to fight and build something greater than myself.

## In a nutshell

If you are looking for motivation, maybe it is not motivation that you should be looking for.

Find your purpose. Let *rage* drive you and get after it!

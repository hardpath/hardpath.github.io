  [Marine Offshore] Offshore renewals project for a tidal technology company.
---

The project involved an offshore buoy housing a set of drives to capture the power generated by an underwater kite. My work involved the following:

- Configuration of 0.5 MW AC drives (IGBT Supply Unit, Inverter Unit, and Brake Chopper).
- Interface over CAN with Battery Management System on a Li-ion battery rack.
- PLC software development for power management and involving PROFINET communication with the drives.
- HMI software development for control and supervision (offshore and onshore).

Due to the innovative nature of the solution, the power management algorithm development involved building a small scale system for research and development.

Aspects like power regeneration, the voltage drop on the umbilical cable, and generator excitation were extensively researched, and inherent technical challenges were surpassed before deploying in the full-scale system.

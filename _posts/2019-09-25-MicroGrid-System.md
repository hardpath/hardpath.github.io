  [Marine Offshore] Offshore renewals project for a tidal technology company.
---

The project involved an offshore buoy housing a set of drives to capture the power generated by an underwater kite. My work involved the following:

- Configuration of 0.5 MW AC drives (IHBT Supply Unit, Inverter Unit, and Brake Chopper).
- Interface over CAN with Battery Management System on a Li-ion battery rack.
- PLC software development for power management and involving PROFINET communication with the drives.
- HMI software development for control and supervision (offshore and onshore).

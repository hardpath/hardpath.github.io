  [Marine] DC Drives upgrade on a research vessel.
---

Two propulsion DC Drives, operating in a Master-Slave configuration, were upgraded in conjunction with the Bow Thruster DC Drive.

A PLC was dedicated to each drive. The software developed so that a failure in one drive does not prevent the other from operating normally, despite being configured as Master-Slave.

The two independent PLCs also managed three control locations and were supervised by a dedicated HMI in the Engine Control Room.

The project involved produced all the documentation (FDS, Test Procedures, Failure Modes analysis, etc.) for Class approval.

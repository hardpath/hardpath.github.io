I wrote this text some time ago for someone very special to me. I ended up
reading it to me more often than I ever thought. Now, I'm sharing with you.

### 1 Know Yourself
Being alone, away from the comfort of everyday life and from those close to us,
is essential. Do not be afraid of putting yourself in challenging situations -
you will find strength in who you are and what really matters to you.

### 2 Have a Focused Vision for Your Life
I agree with the saying, "it's not about the destination; it's about the
journey". However, it will be disappointing, to say the least, to live with joy
and end up in a place of misery. So, find where you want to go and be ferocious
in pursuing that path.

### 3 Choose Wisely the People Around You
Some say we become the average of the five people we spend the most time with.
If the people around us aren't consistent with who we are and do not support us
in where we want to go, we will be better away from them.

### 4 Keep a Healthy Body
Everything falls apart when our body is not well.
For thousands of years, the body has been subjected to intense physical
activity, given the need for food. The comfort of our society has twisted in
"half a dozen years", what took thousands of years to perfect.
Aim to get two hours of exercise a day, but more importantly, be consistent.

### 5 Be Mindful of the Present Moment
In the same way we train our body to keep it healthy, we need to train our mind
to be in the present moment and detach from the past that already happened and
from the future that we do not know if it will ever happen.

### 6 Be Kind To Yourself
If I treated the people around me the same way I treated myself, I would be
completely alone right now. As
[@jordanbpeterson](https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson) said, "treat yourself
like someone you are responsible for helping".

### 7 Be Driven By Love
Look beyond yourself and find the joy of giving yourself to those around you.
If you find yourself doing that whilst experiencing a deep sense of freedom,
you found love. Allow your life to be driven that way, and you will have a
fulfiled one.

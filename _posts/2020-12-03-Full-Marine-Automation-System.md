  [Marine] Full automation system for a Hopper Dredger.
---

A full automation system was deployed, which involved configuring 2000 A DC drives for the propulsion, bow thruster and dredge pump.
The PLC software development entailed the following functionalities:

- DC Drives control (one PLC per DC drive)
- Diesel engines monitoring
- Power management
- Hydraulic system control
- Instrumentation data gathering

Redundant PLCs and redundant servers support the overall operation and supervision of the entire ship. Each drive PLC is integrated into the overall automation infrastructure.

It was developed an advanced power management algorithm that, in conjunction with Protection and Power Management Units, ensures optimal power usage and engines' protection.

The entire system is controlled and supervised by the MAP-OE platform and involves PC-based operating stations in three locations.

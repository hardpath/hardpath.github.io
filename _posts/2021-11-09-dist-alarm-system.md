  [Marine] Distributed Alarm System for ships
---

The Installation simplicity distinguishes this Alarm System from traditional
alarm systems installed on ships.

An Ethernet ring interconnects four PLCs (expandable to 64) where all the
instrumentation is connected.

Each PLC manages the alarms associated with the instrumentation connected there.

Supervision is performed on a Panel PC (on the Bridge) and a graphical console
in the Engine Room. An alarm extension panel is installed in the Accommodation
to announce alarms when the machinery space is unattended.

Simultaneous alarm logs stored in the Panel PC and on the graphical console
make the system redundant.

On my daily struggle to improve efficiency and get the job done, the way I managed my tasks, it is not critical only for me but for my team. In this article, I share my experience.

I remember those days when in the evening I look to my day I nothing was done and the sight of next day demands kept me awake all night. Those days are gone.

## Clarity Is Key

The majority of us usually have more than one thing to do, each with specific deadlines and relevance. In our mind, in the paper or wherever it suits us, tasks should be precise. Its importance and urgency clearly defined – if we don’t exactly know when and what has to be achieved, all the subsequent effort might be lost entirely.

## Multitasking – The Myth

When handling multiple tasks, one needs to prioritise and execute on one at each time. There are no magic tricks.

Some say they can perform more than one task at the same time. That might be true if we are talking about breathing and writing an e-mail or walk and talk with someone else. In that case, yes, we can (simple) multitask.

However, if you are writing an e-mail and answer a phone call at the same time, the experience for the person on the other side of the phone line might not be the best. Not to mention, for example, driving and texting. I believe everyone had this experience at some point. The way our brain handle (complex) multitasking is just like any computer processor. The brain allocates time slots to each task, executing one at a time and switching from one to another. This process has a negative consequence in the productivity and quality of the work produced.

## Prioritise

Having in mind that only one task has to be executed at a time, we need to prioritise. However, this can be a challenge by itself. Let’s look at the following illustration regarding tasks’ importance and urgency.

### Hell

For different reasons, tasks may slip into this area. These tasks have to be ones to be first addressed. There is no pointing handling all the other tasks and leave these burning forever. One question should be made in advance. Is if it is possible to negotiate the deadlines without interfering with the overall goals?

That means to move tasks from Hell to Paradise using the illustration above. If yes, great. If no, then once again: prioritise according to the urgency/importance and execute.

### Paradise

In paradise is where everyone likes to be – doing something meaningful and time to do it. Our daily effort should be to keep all our tasks in this group. If several tasks are in this area, again, prioritise and execute. Start with the ones with a closer deadline. For tasks with the same deadline, start with the most important one or the one with more dependencies.

### Den of Sin

What can be urgent and not important? Let me give some examples. Remember that popup on the bottom right corner of our monitor every time an e-mail is received? What about the mobile phone vibration every time a friend tags us on social media? All this drags our attention for something that definitely can wait. These distractions undermine our effort to have our tasks controlled and get the job done. All these distractions should be eliminated and time slots allocated during the day for this kind of activities.

Another relevant issue is the way people interact with (or should I say, interrupt) each other. I will expose this in another article.

### No Man’s Land

If some tasks do not generate value, don’t do it. If tasks are needed and can be delegated, then delegate them.

Why spend two hours in the supermarket when I can spend 10 minutes at home, place an order online and have the groceries delivered to my door?

Some tasks are needed to support our lives. One should find ways to minimise the effort spent. For example, I cook all my meals. The way I minimise the effort spent on these tasks is by cooking the majority of my meals on the weekend and freeze them to be available during the week.

## In a Nutshell

High productivity can only be achieved if we clearly know when and what has to be achieved. Then, once all distractions are eliminated, prioritise and execute.

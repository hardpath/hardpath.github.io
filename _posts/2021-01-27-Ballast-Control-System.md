  [Marine] Ballast Control System for two Ro-Ro Cargo Ships.
---

Fully redundant control system to control and monitoring of tank levels and valve operation.

Redundant PLCs deal with the activation of valves and data gathering from field instrumentation (levels transmitters, pressure transmitters, level switches).

This project was deployed using the MAP-OE Integrated Machinery Automation & Control System.

Redundant serves support a SCADA infrastructure involving three control locations (Bridge, Engine Control Room, and Cargo Control Room), each equipped with a PC-based operating station (desktop PC and Panel - touchscreen - PC). All SCADA machines are interconnected in an Ethernet ring which also includes the redundant PLCs.

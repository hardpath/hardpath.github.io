  [Nuclear] Nuclear waste robot handling system.
---

An advanced control system to manage a strict handling process involving robot manipulation and laser cutting.
The project involved to main areas of development:

- PLC software manages all active devices and instrumentation in conjunction with the safety (nuclear and conventional hazards)  features.
- SCADA software facilitates the robot's remote control by guiding the operator through a validated and strick handling process.

An innovative two-factor authentication system was developed that integrates the SCADA authentication system, physical keys, and the safety controller (emergency circuit).

A standard SCADA platform was used but highly customised to meet the operational requirements and the safety features inherent to nuclear materials handling.

This project also included the cybersecurity aspects, covering all configurable and programmable devices to the SCADA server deployment and Ethernet infrastructure.
